    * [SGF-238] - "jndi-prop" is not parced correctly

    * [SGF-242] - When defining "membership-attributes" for a Region, the bean definition "required-roles" attribute is required and, when specified, causes a BeanCreationException in the Spring container during initialization.
    * [SGF-244] - The nested <gfe:gateway-sender/>, <gfe:event-filter/> element is missing the ref attribute in the XSD.
    * [SGF-245] - <gfe:cache> always creates cache with default values ignoring all the specified attributes

    * [SGF-247] - boolean based repository queries generate UnsupportedOperationException in non PDX serialized entities
    * [SGF-249] - The SDG XSD is restricting the use of property placeholder values on <gfe:disk-store/>, compaction-threshold attributes given the attribute type is a short and not string.
    * [SGF-251] - Creating and using GemFire Repositories based on the Spring Data Commons Repository abstraction does not work properly for domain objects stored in Subregions. 
    * [SGF-252] - Spring GemFire's Repository extension does not properly handle multiple, identically named Subregions for persisting corresponding application domain objects associated by way of the @Region annotation.

    * [SGF-241] - Add support for defining client sub-Regions using nested <gfe:client-region/> SDG XML namespace elements.
    * [SGF-256] - Upgrade to the latest version of the Spring Framework (3.2.8) and Spring Data Commons (1.8.0)
